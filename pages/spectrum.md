Harmonizing the use of spectrum bands across geographies is essential to achieving mass-market conditions that enables efficient usage of this natural resource as well as benefits of economies of scale. 

The spectrum workgroup of the 5GIF focuses on deliberations aimed at the technical aspects of
spectrum matters in India.
1. Technical studies related to various services in spectrum to enable usage of 3GPP technologies and
applications by telecom operators and industry players
2. The deliverables of the workgroup will become contributions to various national preparatory groups
discussing inputs to WRC, ITU-R, AWG and APT
3. Conduct workshops to disseminate informations that can assist national decisions on radio-regulations
implementation at national level. (E.g mmwave implementation at national level)
4. Develop tools and knowledge base for spectrum discussion within national stakeholders
