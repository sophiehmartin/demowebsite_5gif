## COAI and its role in unifying Industry inputs on 5G

COAI is a market representation partner (MRP) of 3GPP. As 3GPP technology is now being applied to a diverse number of ‘verticals’, this is the best possible time for the 5GIF to bring a coordinated industry based approach to the standards process within India, one that will help to align 3GPP to the emerging needs of industry automation.

## COAI engagement with the 5G-ACIA

The 5G-ACIA, another 3GPP MRP is an active player in the industrial automation space. Their membership base includes a number of industrial equipment suppliers and end-users as well as ICT companies; with the automotive, energy, industrial manufacturing and production sectors all represented. COAI has an MoU with the 5G-ACIA in working together developing solutions for industrial IoT and automation, with an emphasis for the Indian region.

## 5G for Industry Workgroup

The Inudstry workgroup takes care of the interaction with other initiatives and organizations by establishing liaison activities and initiating suitable promotional measures. This group also leads the discussions with industry and regulatory, and supports in creating mindshare around industrial automation adoption.
